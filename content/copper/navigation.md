Main navigation
---------------

1. `[[menu.main]]` is the main loop; You can add your navigation item by copying and pasting this line.
2. `name` attribute is for navigation item name.
3. `URL` is for the page url; Just give the page name here, it will automatically add the base URL from your site. like if you want to give the about page url here, just type `about` .
4. `weight` is for your navigation sorting; The smaller number weight will show first.
5. For `dropdown menu` you need to add another attribute called `hasChildren = true` , and remove `URL`. then give 1 tab space for understanding hugo that is a children menu item. and paste this `[[menu.main]]` again, then give the `parent =` attribute here. parent name should be the dropdown item name, then give the page `name` and `URL`.
6. `navBtn` is for the navigation button that we provided in this theme; If you donâ€™t want it, you can simply turn this off, You will see `navBtn` at the bottom of the main navigation. You can set `enable = false` to hide this button. The default value is `true`. You can set button label and url here. this url is also like the navigation url, you just need to give the page name.
